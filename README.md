Various utility modules to do stuff I find useful in different projects.

* ptree - a hierarchic tree of named nodes where children ore an ordered dict and can be referenced using filesystem like syntax and slicing
* netinf - pure python to extract info about network interfaces on linux boxes
* pvars - managed variables for apps using tree structuring (from ptree) and with functionailty to help with abstracting gui from app logic
